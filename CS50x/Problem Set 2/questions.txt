P Set Questions:

How does a while loop differ from a do-while loop? When is the latter particularly useful?
- A do-while loop runs AT LEAST once and checks the condition AFTER the body of the loop. For example, if you want to check the input of a user and have it loop until the user provides a positive input, a do-while loop works very well for this, since the first time the loop runs, the user hasn't given an input yet, so the condition can't be checked initially.

What does undeclared identifier usually indicate if outputted by make (or, really, clang)?
This is what happens when you try to use a variable that has not yet been declared. 

Why is Caesar’s cipher not very secure?
A computer can simply work to shift the letters in 25 different manners and will quickly deliver a result. Moreover, there are very obvious patterns within the encrypted text (such as repeating vowels like e in words like "meet") which in a sense, gives away the pattern of the cipher and the underlying text.

What’s a function?

Why bother writing functions when you can just copy and paste code as needed?
